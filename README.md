# Cobweb: Student Networking Platform

## Introduction
Cobweb is a modern web application designed to help students connect, collaborate, and grow their academic networks. Inspired by the idea of weaving connections through "web" projects, Cobweb enables users to find, join and collaborate on projects. The platform features project management, real-time chat, and a beautiful, responsive UI.

## How Cobweb Relates to the Theme
The theme for this project is **networking**. Cobweb embodies this by providing a digital space where students can:
- Discover and join projects or study groups
- Connect with others based on shared interests
- Communicate in real-time
- Build a personal network that hopefully extends beyond the classroom

Cobweb directly addresses the networking theme, making it easy for students to find opportunities

## Unique & Interesting Features
Cobweb stands out from other student networking apps with:
- **Animations**: Animations using framer motion on all pages
- **Search & Filter**: Search and filter functionalities when browsing projects
- **User account system**: Use of JWTs with .NET Identity to securely authenticate users
